# Pixel War: Building a Competitive and Secure Multiplayer Game

Welcome to the **Pixel War Project**, an ambitious venture aiming to create a secure, fun, and highly competitive multiplayer pixel art game. Imagine a massive digital canvas where users from all over the world can collaboratively place blocks and colors, similar to the viral concept of pixel wars. With the help of skilled contributors and passionate players, this project has the potential to redefine the genre while providing both financial and learning opportunities.

## **Project Vision**

The primary goal of this project is to create a secure, interactive, and enjoyable experience for users. Here's what we aim to achieve:

1. **Massive Multiplayer Gameplay**: 
   - Users can place blocks on a shared canvas to create collaborative or competitive art.
   - Each block placement triggers a cooldown to encourage fair play and strategy.

2. **Security and Anti-Cheat Systems**:
   - A secure **login system** will ensure only real players participate. 
   - Upon registration, players will receive a unique **hash** via email, which they must use to log in.
   - Only emails from trusted providers (`@gmail`, `@yahoo`, `@outlook`, `@icloud`, `@hotmail`) will be accepted, ensuring bot prevention.
   - Anti-cheat mechanisms will monitor for suspicious activity to maintain fair play, banning users who attempt to exploit the system.

3. **VIP System**:
   - Standard players must wait **3 minutes and 30 seconds** between block placements.
   - VIP players enjoy a reduced cooldown of just **1 minute and 25 seconds**. 
   - VIP passes will be available for **$20 each**, targeting 200–1,000 VIP users. This could generate between **$4,000 to $20,000** in revenue, helping sustain the game's development and operations.

4. **Scaling for Success**:
   - The ultimate goal is to host at least **100,000 active players**.
   - Secure, scalable infrastructure will support the growing player base while delivering a seamless experience.
